He's been hunting him down for laps, studying his prey, and finally, he's made it count! The Renault's superior pace on the soft tires has given H\u00fclkenberg the edge he needed to snatch 16th place from Ocon's grasp! That's a masterclass in overtaking, folks! The battle for the lower midfield positions is heating up, and H\u00fclkenberg is right in the thick of it!\""

A beautifully executed pass on the inside of turn 12, and Ricciardo is THROUGH! He's up to 13th place now, and Ocon is forced to concede! That's some serious racing nous from the Aussie, folks! He's got the bit between his teeth, and he's not done yet! The crowd is loving it, and we're loving it too! RICCIARDO ON THE MARCH!\""
